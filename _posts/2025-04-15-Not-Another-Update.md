What do community organisers need? Not Another Pizza.

## Why Not Another Pizza?
-----

Not Another Pizza is a community of community organisers loosely centered on London in the UK. It is born out of a desire to share resources and make it easier for organisers to find collaborators.

I know from first-hand experience that running events, particularly regular events, is hard and hopefully this group can help make it easier for both folks new to organising and for experience organisers who might be feeling a bit burned out or need a bit of support.

I'd like to grow our community on [Discord](https://discord.notanother.pizza) to make it easier for organisers to find each other and build out this site with links to resources, tools, and projects.

If you'd like to get involved in helping to build Not Another Pizza please fire a message over in the [#general](https://discord.com/channels/1346485469088714847/1346485469827043350) channel over on Discord.
